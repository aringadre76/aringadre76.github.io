# Arin Gadre - Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects and experience. Built it from scratch using React and some really cool animation libraries I found.

## 🚀 What I Used
- **React 19** with TypeScript (because I love type safety)
- **Vite** for super fast development (seriously, it's amazing)
- **React Router** for smooth navigation
- **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment (set it and forget it)
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting (free and reliable)
- **ReactBits.dev** components for those sick animations

## 🛠️ Want to Run This Locally?

If you want to check out the code or run it yourself, here's how:

```bash
# Clone the repo and install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server (usually runs on localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

## 📦 How It Deploys

I set up GitHub Actions so every time I push to main, it automatically builds and deploys to GitHub Pages. Pretty neat, right? No manual deployment needed.

## 🎨 The Cool Stuff

I found this amazing library called [ReactBits.dev](https://reactbits.dev) and used a bunch of their components to make this site look really polished:

- **Prism Background** - This 3D rotating thing that follows your mouse (so satisfying)
- **TextType** - Makes the text type out like a typewriter
- **DecryptedText** - Matrix-style text reveal (looks super cool)
- **GooeyNav** - Navigation with these smooth particle effects
- **ElectricBorder** - Animated borders that look like electricity

Seriously, check out [ReactBits.dev](https://reactbits.dev) - they have tons of awesome React components that are easy to use and look professional.

## 🎯 What's Here

Right now it's a pretty solid portfolio site with smooth animations and a clean design.

### What You'll Find
- **Home** - Landing page with animated hero text and background
- **About** - A bit about me and what I do
- **Projects** - Some of the stuff I've built (with links to GitHub)
- **Experience** - My work history and internships
- **Contact** - Ways to get in touch with me
- **Resume** - PDF download (still working on this one)
